# basic-rock-paper-scissors
a simple project in js

No big work here since we're gonna redo the project later, so just try to make it work o.o

I added a css file and an images folder, it's purely for show and to try and make an habit out of it, I won't use it.

So how will it work ?

we want to make multiple RPS (rock paper scissors) iterations, while keeping score. For now, we want one game to be 5 rounds.

so a game should be : 
lauching the game
taking user input (case-insensitive)
generate computer choice
check who won
save the score
reiterate till 5 rounds are done
show final score
